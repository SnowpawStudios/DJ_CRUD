# DJ_CRUD

This is a simple django app that serves as a template for using function based views and modelforms to perform crud operations.

The main points are:
- Function based views to perform create, read, update, and delete operations
- Model forms to quickly create forms directly linked to a model
- Register a model in admin so it can be viewed in django admin
- Url mapping to a specific app
- Shows how to setup a template folder at the project level and inherit from a base template
- Shows how to setup global static files (css, js, images) from a project level folder and how to link to this in the base template

Note the styling is basic and only there to illustrate how to implement css in django.
